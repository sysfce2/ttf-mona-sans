# Mona Sans

[Download Mona Sans](https://github.com/github/mona-sans/releases/latest) • [Typeface microsite](https://github.com/mona-sans) ↗️

A strong and versatile typeface, designed together with [Degarism](https://degarism.com/) and inspired by industrial-era grotesques. Mona Sans works well across product, web, and print. Made to work well together with  Mona Sans's sidekick, [Hubot Sans](https://github.com/github/hubot-sans).

Mona Sans is a [variable font](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/). Variable fonts enable different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into one single file, and are supported by all major browsers, allowing for performance benefits and granular design control of the typeface's weight, width, and slant.

## Variable font usage

The design space is large, so we've split the font up into a few variable fonts.

If you want to access the whole design space, use `MonaSansVF[wdth,wght,opsz,ital]`. On the web, you can utilize points on that space like this:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Mona Sans VF';
  src:
    url('MonaSansVF[wdth,wght,opsz,ital].woff2') format('woff2 supports variations'),
    url('MonaSansVF[wdth,wght,opsz,ital].woff2') format('woff2-variations');
  font-weight: 200 900;
  font-stretch: 75% 125%;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
}

html {
  font-family: 'Mona Sans VF';
}
```

Mona Sans includes an optical size axis (`opsz`) that automatically adjusts the font's design for optimal readability at different sizes. The optical size range spans from 1 to 100, where smaller values (1-20) are optimized for body text with improved readability, while larger values (21-100) are designed for display use with refined details and tighter spacing. When `font-optical-sizing: auto` is set, browsers will automatically select the appropriate optical size based on the font size, or you can manually control it using `font-variation-settings: "opsz" [value]`. That looks like this:

```css
.heading {
  font-variation-settings: "wght" 700, "wdth" 125, "opsz" 72; /* Bold, Expanded, Display size */
}

.body-text {
  font-variation-settings: "wght" 400, "wdth" 100, "opsz" 12; /* Regular, Normal width, Text size */
}
```

To reduce [CLS](https://web.dev/cls/), you can preload the font in the `head` of your document:

```html
<link rel="preload" href="MonaSansVF[wdth,wght,opsz,ital].woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

Or you can use one of the other variable font files, which cover small portions of the design space. For example, if you're only using the regular width weights and the italic styles, you can use the `MonaSansVF[wght,opsz,ital]` file instead.

## Stylistic sets

Mona Sans has ten stylistic sets:

| Set | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| ss01 | Square diacritical marks | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8be9ca8-8d7a-46d5-843a-7dfc0ca9a171" width="400"> |
| ss02 | Wide uppercase I | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f971d907-c8a5-4fbf-ac75-bf3411a00f57" width="400"> |
| ss03 | Lowercase l with tail | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20dd37c-f7ba-4964-8888-dd679ed7d3fc" width="400"> |
| ss04 | Lowercase l with top serif | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aa71393-642e-4989-843d-4c2b9d6b5a1c" width="400"> |
| ss05 | Double-storey a | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c411d743-0bb8-4f15-ad30-769c6d5b83d5" width="400"> |
| ss06 | Double-storey g | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc640587-6505-49a9-836c-a4a091b0a4cb" width="400"> |
| ss07 | Square G | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c973b98-8398-4ab2-bb74-45980de799ea" width="400"> |
| ss08 | Tabular zero with straight bar | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1efe404b-ca17-4dbb-877e-47a7080d2785" width="400"> |
| ss09 | Q with diagonal arm | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f7f28e7-d325-496a-8362-21d7a71b362a" width="400"> |
| ss10 | J with bowl | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a0776c8-8acf-41ad-ba23-e26515bc1f8e" width="400"> |

When using Mona Sans on the web, you can control each stylistic set with the syntax `"ssXX" on/off`. If you wanted square diacritical marks, small letter L distinct from capital I, and alternative small letter g it would look like this:

```css
html {
  font-family: 'Mona Sans VF';
  font-feature-settings: "ss01" on, "ss03" on, "ss05" on;
}
```

## Ligatures
